# Airline Dashboard

This is a small React dashboard that works with my Airline API. It lets you search flights, check passenger bookings, and view the busiest routes. All the data comes from a MongoDB Atlas database through an Express API.

The dashboard is built with React + Vite and is deployed on Vercel.

### Live Demo
